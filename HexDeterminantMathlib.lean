/-!
The `HexDeterminantMathlib` library is the Mathlib bridge for `hex-determinant`.
It connects the executable Leibniz determinant `Hex.Matrix.det` to Mathlib's
`Matrix.det` (`det_eq`), together with the permutation-sign transport, the
Desnanot-Jacobi bordered-minor identity used by the Bareiss correctness proof,
and the four-row / double-row Grassmann-Plücker assembly. This module
re-exports the determinant correspondence core.
